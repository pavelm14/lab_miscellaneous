# Historical biogeography inference

This is a tutorial to estimate ancestral distributional areas and macroevolutionary dispersal through time between areas.

We use model-based inferences using the R package BioGeoBEARS ([Matzke, 2013](https://doi.org/10.21425/F5FBG19694)). For more information about the functionalities, please visit the program's wiki: http://phylo.wikidot.com/biogeobears

For people aiming to run the analyses using the Czech computer cluster [Metacentrum](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/index.html), you can follow our tutorial ([click here](https://github.com/pavelm14/lab_miscellaneous/tree/main/Rpackages)) describing the process of installing R packages and running R scripts there.

## Input files

- A time-calibrated molecular phylogeny in Newick format
- A distributional matrix containing the extant areas occupied by each species in the study phylogeny
